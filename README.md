This is the file manager app for Papyros. The UI is build with our [Material Design framework](https://github.com/papyros/qml-material), and the backend is based on the [Ubuntu Touch file manager](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-filemanager-app). The goal is for the app to be cross platform and run on Linux, OS X, and Windows.
